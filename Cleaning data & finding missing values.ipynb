 it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8\".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td><td>5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td><td>General                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>Dresses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td><td>Dresses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.            </td><td>2

 it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8\".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.                                                                                                                                                                                                      & 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    & General                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Dresses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & Dresses                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\\\\n",

           & I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.             & 2

          | I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress.             | 2
